My answers to the exercises from the University of Helsinkiâ€™s free massive open online course (MOOC) on object orientated programming: Java Programming I.

Completed between 20/05/2022 and 23/07/2022 (Date format: dd/mm/yyyy).

Note: Exercises uploaded to github on 24/07/2022 (dd/mm/yyyy). Some exercises are missing due to changing computers during the course. I will upload these exercises from my TestMyCode at some point.
